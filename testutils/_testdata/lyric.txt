Cigarette ash like wildfire
Burning holes in the nighttime
Open scars feel like barbed wire
White lies flying high like a ceasefire
Dropping flags on the shore line
This is as far as I can feel right
'Cause what you don't know can haunt you
And all we ever wanted was
Sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down 'cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause happy endings' hardest to fake
Yeah
Sunsets on power lines
Making a break through the other side
Heading out to where that sunshine
45 millimeter rolling like we lost time
Polaroids and outcast
Rather burn out young than grow up fast
And we could be forever futurebound
'Cause all I need is time and now
And I could leave this past behind me (And all we ever wanted was-)
And maybe I'll see a way for me to stay (Sunlight and honesty, highlights to wanna-)
When there's so much out there (Repeat, let's get away from-)
So I'll live forgetting for the time being (And live like the movies do)
And I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down 'cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause everything was never the same
And I wanna let you know
I wanna let you go
But I just can't bring myself to speak
But this is how it goes
The end credits they roll
This bridge was built over kerosene
But we can watch it
And all I ever wanted was
Sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down 'cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
And you could wish away forever
But you'll never find a thing like today
