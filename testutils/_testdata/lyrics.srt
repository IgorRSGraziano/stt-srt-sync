1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
I don't know, I just remember it being so much brighter, I guess

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,600
cigarette ash like wildfire burning holes in the night time

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,360
open scars feel like barbed wire white lights flying high like a ceasefire

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,320
drop of flags on the shoreline this is as far as I can feel right

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,279
because while you don't know can haunt you and all we ever wanted was sunlight and honesty

6
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:54,000
highlights to wanna repeat let's get away from here and live like the movies do I won't mind

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,320
when it's over at least I didn't think for a while don't drag it out living like what doesn't mean

8
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,000
so let's run make a great escape and I'll be waiting outside for the getaway it doesn't

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,519
matter who we are we'll keep running through the dark and all that we need is another day

10
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,599
we can slow down because tomorrow is a mile away and live like shooting stars

11
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:37,279
because happy endings hardest to say yeah sunsets and power lines making a break for the other side

12
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,959
heading out to where the sun shines 45 millimeter rolling like we lost time

13
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:50,959
polaroids and outcasts rather burn out young and grow fast and we could be forever future bound

14
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:57,519
because all I need is time and now and I could leave this past behind me and maybe I'll see

15
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:07,519
a way for me to stay when there's so much out there so I'll live forgetting for the time being

16
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:16,639
and I won't mind when it's over at least I didn't think for a while

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,600
so let's run make a great escape and I'll be waiting outside for the getaway it doesn't matter

18
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,600
who we are we'll keep running through the dark and all that we need is another day we can slow down

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,279
because tomorrow is a mile away and live like shooting stars because everything was never the

20
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:54,880
same and I wanna let you know I wanna let you go but I just can't bring myself to speak but this

21
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:06,720
is how it goes the end credits they're all this bridge was built over kerosene but we can watch

22
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,720
oh

23
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,720
make a great escape and I'll be waiting outside for the getaway it doesn't matter who we are

24
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,720
running through the dark and all I ever need is another day we can slow down because tomorrow is

25
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:55,039
in my way
